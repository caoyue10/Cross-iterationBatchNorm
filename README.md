This repo is an official implementation of ["Cross-Iteration Batch Normalization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05712) on COCO object detection based on open-mmlab's mmdetection. This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the CBN layer, as well as some training scripts to reproduce the COCO object detection and instance segmentation results reported in our paper.

## Introduction

**CBN** is initially described in [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05712). A well-known issue of Batch Normalization is its significantly reduced effectiveness in the case of small mini-batch sizes. Here we present Cross-Iteration Batch Normalization (CBN), in which examples from multiple recent iterations are jointly utilized to enhance estimation quality. A challenge is that the network activations from different iterations are not comparable to each other due to changes in network weights. We thus compensate for the network weight changes via a proposed technique based on Taylor polynomials, so that the statistics can be accurately estimated. On object detection and image classification with small mini-batch sizes, CBN is found to outperform the original batch normalization and a direct calculation of statistics over previous iterations without the proposed compensation technique.

./tools/dist_train.sh ./configs/cbn/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_syncbn_1x.py 4
# GN
./tools/dist_train.sh ./configs/cbn/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_gn_1x.py 4
# CBN
./tools/dist_train.sh ./configs/cbn/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_cbn_buffer3_burnin8_1x.py 4
```
